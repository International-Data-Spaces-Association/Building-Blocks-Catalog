# Data Exchange APIs

## Definition
<div align="justify"> This building block facilitates the sharing and exchange of data (i.e., data provision and data 
  consumption/use) between data space participants. An example of a data interoperability building block is the ‘Context Broker’ 
  of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF),  which is recommended by the European Commission for sharing right-time (near real-time)data 
  among multiple organisations.</div> 

## Role and Scope
<div allign="justify">Facilitates data sharing and exchange between data space participants, ensuring semantic interoperability of 
  data and data sources.</div>

## Technical Reference Implementation

<details>
  <summary><strong>Design Principles Position Paper</strong></summary>
  
<div align="justify">A smart city needs to calculate its environmental performance on the basis of a collection and aggregation of 
  information about all the sustainability projects in its urban environment. This information is shared by different stakeholders, 
  who use different formats and semantics to report CO2 emissions and other indicators. The building block enables syntactic and 
  semantic harmonization of the different data sources, as well as effective exchange of data using a common data exchange API to 
  enable the calculation of the KPIs (key performance indicators) needed.</div>
