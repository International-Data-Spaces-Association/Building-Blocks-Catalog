  <summary><strong>Design Principles Position Paper</strong></summary>
<div align="justify">The Smart Agrifood domain needs a common representation of agronomic data (e.g. crops, senso data from the field, multispectral imagery from UAVs, geolocation data, fertilisation logs, â€¦). This common data model shall be used for all data exchanged between software components.</div>

  <summary><strong>i3-Market Project</strong></summary>
<div align="justify">"Data offering" allows to describe the capabilities and interfaces of an i3-MARKET data asset from a provider perspective and how this information can be used for discovery and access purpose but at the same time provides information towards the commercial use of the data asset.</div>

  <summary><strong>Smart Connected Supplier Network</strong></summary>
<div align="justify">The need of sharing data is crucial in low volume industry, like semiconductor industry. Nowadays, every industry adopts different standards and understandings of the same information, which provokes that a lot of work has to be done manually and it is not digitized. Furthermore, manual actions have a huge impact in the final price and they require extra effort. By using data standards and IDS components, the process is digitized, some errors are avoided and the effort is minimized. Besides, it enables the small manufacturing companies to join the digitalization process. Until now, they were sometimes excluded due to the high cost of hiring IT professionals (they have less budget).</div>
