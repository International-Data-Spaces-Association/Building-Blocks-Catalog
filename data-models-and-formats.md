# Data Models and Formats

## Definition
<div align="justify">This building block establishes a common format for data model specifications and serialization  of data in data exchange payloads. Combined with the Data Exchange APIs building block, this ensures full interoperability among participants.</div>

## Role and Scope
It facilitates a common format for data model specifications and representation of data.

## Features 
### DSBA - CTO architecture coherence
- Standardized  data format for exchange of messages
- Common data Models agreed among participants
- Provide data Models
- Describe data format

### i3-Market Project
- Creation and registration of the data offering description


## Components and Technologies
### DSBA - CTO architecture coherence
- JSON-LD (amongst others, like RDF)
- Smart Data Models
- Vocabulary Provider Component
- The descriptions and more information in [IDS Infomodel](https://w3id.org/idsa/core). (RDF*, JSON-LD*, Linked Data Proofs, BBS+ Signatuores, ODLR, SHACL, Schema.org, ...)

### i3-Market Project
- Semantic Engine
- Semantic Model (OCASUS)
- i3-Market SDK-Generator
- Distributed staraage, decentralized storage
- SDK-core; SDK-RI

## Technical Reference Implementation
### i3-Market Project
- Pricing Model
- Contract Model
- Data Schema
- Relational Data Schema

## Business Use Cases Implementation
### Design Principles Position Paper
The Smart Agrifood domain needs a common representation of agronomic data (e.g. crops, senso data from the field, multispectral imagery from UAVs, geolocation data, fertilisation logs, â€¦). This common data model shall be used for all data exchanged between software components.

### i3-Market Project
"Data offering" allows to describe the capabilities and interfaces of an i3-MARKET data asset from a provider perspective and how this information can be used for discovery and access purpose but at the same time provides information towards the commercial use of 
the data asset.
