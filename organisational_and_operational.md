# Organisational/operational building blocks

## Definition

The organizational level refers to the way in which the agreements, expectations and processes are aligned to achieve the common goals for controlled data sharing. This includes the onboarding and certification (according to common and accepted criteria), aligned service level agreements (for realizing overarching expectations and quality control) and aligned operations and customer processes (for improved operating efficiency and enhanced customer experience).

<summary><strong>MyData</strong></summary>

<summary><strong>iSHARE Foundation</strong></summary>

Data Spaces build upon [iSHARE](https://ishare.eu/ishare/the-foundation/governance/)â€™s trust framework define their own standards and working and governance. Within that governance data spaces decide on the Taxonomy, Interoperability and Value creation of the data within the data space.![](images/iShare\_Goverance.png)
