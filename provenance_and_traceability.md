# Provenance and traceability

## Definition
<div align="justify">This building block provides the means for tracing and tracking in the process of data provision and data consumption/use. It thereby provides the basis for a number of important functions, from identification of the lineage of data to audit-proof logging of transactions. It also enables implementation of a wide range of tracking use cases at application level, such as tracking of products or material flows in a supply chain.</div>

  <summary><strong>Design Principles Position Paper</strong></summary>
  
<div align="justify">In the scope of a circular supply chain, there is need for providing end-to-end traceability of the status and conditions of key circular entities, like products or materials. The building block allows authorised participants to query on the status of specific products and materials, and to receive detailed information about their status and location in the circular chain.</div>
