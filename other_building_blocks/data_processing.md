# Data Processing

## Definition
<div align="justify">Systems connected to data spaces via system adapters are able to process shared data to enforce data usage restrictions. The organisationsâ€™ rules or legal contracts can be substituted or at least accompanied by technical solutions. However, such processing adds additional complexity to data usage control by data providers or data space operators. In order to exert wider control, data spaces may incorporate different stages of usage control, as provided by the concept of the usage control onion, (e.g. for data accountability/traceability or access/usage control) with data-processing technologies.</div>
